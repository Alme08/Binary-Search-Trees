# Binary-Search-Trees

An implementation of a binary search tree data structure written in JavaScript.

Includes the following methods:

- insert(value) - inserts a new node with the given value into the tree
- remove(value) - removes the node holding the given value from the tree
- find(value) - returns the node holding the given value in the tree
- levelOrder() - traverses each node of the tree in level order
- inorder() - traverses each node of the tree inorder
- preorder() - traverses each node of the tree preorder
- postorder() - traverses each node of the tree postorder
- height() - returns the height of a node -- defined as the longest path between the node and a leaf node
- depth() - returns the depth of a node -- defined as the distance between the node and the root
- isBalanced() - returns true/false based on whether or not the tree is balanced
- rebalance() - rebalances the tree
- prettyPrint - prints the tree in the console in a human reader friendly format
  Also included is a small script that tests most of the tree's functionality.
